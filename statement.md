# TASK FORGE - statement

## Problem Statement
Students often forget to revise completed chapters, which reduces long-term retention and exam performance. Existing To-Do List Apps do not understand academic tasks or automatically schedule revision reminders. This project aims to build a Smart To-Do List Revision Planner that manages academic and normal tasks, and automatically schedules revision reminders, so students can revise at the right time.

• Adding, Viewing, Marking as Complete/Incomplete, Deleting Tasks and Subtasks
• Automatically generating Reminders with specific intervals for tasks based on specific category
• Saving Tasks and Reminders

-Future Scope:
• Add Graphical User Interface (GUI)
• Add more features to boost productivity of a student

• Any student or aspirant or a person who wants structured Task Management with structured revision reminders

## High-Level Features 
• Task Management with categories: STUDY, IMPORTANT, NORMAL, DAILY
• Subtasks support for breaking a Task into smaller parts for better management
• Automatic Reminder Generation using spaced intervals for each category
• Reminders Toggle for each Task/Subtask with immediate rescheduling when Turned ON again
